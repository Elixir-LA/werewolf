## Goals:

This project will take our group through the parts of building out a Web-based, multiplayer party game. Our objectives as a group are to build a game that demonstrates Erlang and Elixir concepts through hands-on exercises!

## Rules:

The rules of Werewolf are very similar to the game Mafia. See them: http://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html
